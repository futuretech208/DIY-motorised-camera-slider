# DIY-motorised-camera-slider

Another DIY hardware designed to work with Arduino and to give another way for your creativity in photography. The camera slider board allows you to take timelapse and Panning shots on the camera. Just plug this board to any camera slider which is easy to make from aluminum profile, like the one I have made. 
Use the potentiometer and the microstepping to accurately select the speed you want and just clickkkk..
